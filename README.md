An exercise on the brooklyne students grading
# Brooklyn University is looking for a software solution that should help lecturers in awarding course unit marks or grading, 
# For each unit, they have 2 tests tes1 and test2 and course works for tests they take the best done 
# and add on the coursework marks and the average of the two is out of 40% its the coursework marks

# They have final exam marked out of 60% its exam marks
# final marks of course unit = (course  work marks + exam marks)

# As Python engineer, 
# use at least 3 dynamic functions which accept input of the name of the student, academic year, test1, test2, 
# coursework marks and exam marks and compute the final course unit mark and it should be stored in a
# a text file called 'final_exam.txt'
